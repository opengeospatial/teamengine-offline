/**
 * Addition to the collection framework. Most classes in this package implement interfaces
 * from the <cite>Java Collection Framework</cite> defined in the {@link java.util} package.
 * <ul>
 *   <li><p>
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.WeakHashSet} provides a way to ensure that
 *     a factory returns unique instances for all values that are equal in the sense of
 *     {@link java.lang.Object#equals Object.equals(Object)}. The values that were created
 *     in previous factory operations are retained by {@linkplain java.lang.ref.WeakReference
 *     weak references} for reuse.
 *   </p></li><li><p>
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.Cache} and
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.WeakValueHashMap} are {@link java.util.Map java.util.Map}
 *     implementations that may be used for some caching or pseudo-caching functionalities. The
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.Cache} implementation is the most full-featured one
 *     and supports concurrency, while the other implementations are more lightweight, sometime
 *     thread-safe but without concurrency support.
 *   </p></li><li><p>
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.CheckedCollection},
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.CheckedArrayList},
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.CheckedHashSet} and
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.CheckedHashMap} can be used for combining <em>runtime</em>
 *     type safety with thread-safety (without concurrency). They are similar in functionalities to
 *     the wrappers provided by the standard {@link java.util.Collections} methods, except that they
 *     combine both functionalities in a single class (so reducing the amount of indirection), provide
 *     a hook for making the collections read-only and allow the caller to specify the synchronization
 *     lock of his choice.
 *   </p></li><li><p>
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.DerivedMap} and
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.DerivedSet} are wrapper collections in which the
 *     keys or the values are derived on-the-fly from the content of an other collection.
 *   </p></li><li><p>
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.IntegerList} and
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.RangeSet} are collections specialized for a particular kind
 *     of content, providing more efficient storage than what we would get with the general-purpose
 *     collection implementations.
 *   </p></li><li><p>
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.DisjointSet},
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.KeySortedList} and
 *     {@link org.geotoolkit.util.collection.FrequencySortedSet} provides specialized ways to
 *     organize their elements.
 *   </p></li>
