/**
 * Base class for Geotoolkit.org factories. {@link FactoryRegistry} handles {@code Factory}
 * subclasses specially, but extending this class is not mandatory ({@code FactoryRegistry}
 * will work with arbitrary implementations as well). This base class provides some convenience
 * features for subclasses:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An initially empty map of {@linkplain #hints hints} to be filled by subclasses
 *       constructors.</li>
 *   <li>An opportunity to said whatever this factory {@linkplain #availability is available}.</li>
 *   <li>An opportunity to {@linkplain #setOrdering set the ordering} of this factory relative
 *       to other factories.</li>
 *   <li>An opportunity to {@linkplain #dispose dispose} resources.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * {@section How hints are set}
 * Hints are used for two purposes. The distinction is important because the set
 * of hints may not be identical in both cases:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Hints are used for creating new factories.</li>
 *   <li>Hints are used in order to check if an <em>existing</em> factory is suitable.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * This {@code Factory} base class does <strong>not</strong> provide any facility for the first
 * case. Subclasses shall inspect themselves all relevant hints supplied by the user, and pass them
 * to any dependencies. Do <strong>not</strong> use the {@link #hints} field for that; use the hints
 * provided by the user in the constructor. If all dependencies are created at construction time
 * (<cite>constructor injection</cite>), there is no need to keep all user's hints once the
 * construction is finished.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #hints} field is for the second case only. Implementations shall copy in this field
 * only the user's hints that are know to be relevant to this factory. If a hint is relevant but
 * the user didn't specified any value, the hint key should be added to the {@link #hints} map
 * anyway with a {@code null} value. Only direct dependencies shall be put in the {@link #hints}
 * map. Indirect dependencies (i.e. hints used by other factories used by this factory) will be
 * inspected automatically by {@link FactoryRegistry} in a recursive way.
 *
 * {@section Guidline for subclasses}
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Provide a public no-arguments constructor.</li>
 *   <li>In addition, it is recommended that implementations provide a constructor expecting
 *       a single {@link Hints} argument. This optional argument gives to the user some control
 *       over the factory's low-level details. The amount of control is factory specific.</li>
 *   <li>The lack of constructor expecting a {@link Map} argument is intentional. This is in
 *       order to discourage blind-copy of all user-supplied hints to the {@link #hints} map.</li>
 *   <li>Add the fully qualified name of the <u>implementation</u> class in the
 *       {@code META-INF/services/}<var>classname</var> file where <var>classname</var>
 *       is the fully qualified name of the service <u>interface</u>.</li>
 *   <li>The factory implementations will be discovered when
 *       {@link FactoryRegistry#scanForPlugins} will be invoked.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * {@section Example}
 * An application supplied a {@linkplain Hints#DATUM_FACTORY datum factory hint}, being passed to a
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.datum.DatumAuthorityFactory datum authority factory} so that
 * all datum created from an authority code will come from the supplied datum factory.
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <b>Java code</b>
 * {@preformat java
 *     class DatumAuthorityFactory extends Factory {
 *         final DatumFactory datumFactory;
 *
 *         DatumAuthorityFactory() {
 *             this(EMPTY_HINTS);
 *         }
 *
 *         DatumAuthorityFactory(Hints userHints) {
 *             datumFactory = FactoryFinder.getDatumFactory(userHints);
 *             hints.put(Hints.DATUM_FACTORY, datumFactory);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <b>Remarks</b><br>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The map of ({@code userHints}) is never modified, since it is supplied by the user.</li>
 *   <li>All hints relevant to other factories are used in the constructor. Hints relevant to
 *       {@code DatumFactory} are used when {@code FactoryFinder.getDatumFactory(...)} is invoked.</li>
 *   <li>The {@code DatumAuthorityFactory} constructor stores only the hints relevant to it.
 *       Indirect dependencies (e.g. hints relevant to {@code DatumFactory}) will be inspected
 *       recursively by {@link FactoryRegistry}.</li>
 *   <li>In the above example, {@link #hints} will never be used for creating new factories.</li>
 * </ul></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * As seen in those examples this concept of a hint becomes more interesting when
 * the operation being controlled is discovery of other services used by the factory.
 * By supplying appropriate hints one can chain together several factories and retarget
 * them to an application specific task.
