/**
 * A stream over objects read from memory, a file or sent through a network. This interface can be
 * seen as an iterator where the methods may throw {@link IOException} or {@link RemoteException}.
 * The stream is not allowed to returns {@code null} elements, since the {@code null} value
 * indicates the end of stream.
 *
 * {@section Thread safety}
 * It is implementor responsibility to ensure that {@code ObjectStream} is thread-safe
 * (only the stream; the returned objects don't need to be thread-safe). Thread-safety
 * is a requirement because a stream can be wrapped in RMI objects, in which case many
 * calls from different remote machines may happen simultaneously.
 *
 * {@section Serialization}
 * {@code ObjectStream} implementations are usually not {@linkplain Serializable serializable} since
 * we don't want to cause the serialization of an entire dataset (collection, file, <i>etc.</i>).
 * When a particular instance of {@code ObjectStream} is serializable, this is usually a remote object
 * exported for use through <cite>Remote Method Invocation</cite> (RMI).
 *
 * @param <E> The type of elements returned by the stream.
