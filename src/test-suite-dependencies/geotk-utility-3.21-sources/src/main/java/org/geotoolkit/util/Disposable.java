/**
 * Interface of classes providing a {@link #dispose()} method.
 * This interface is similar to the standard {@link java.io.Closeable} interface, but serve
 * a slightly different purpose. The {@code Closeable} interface is for closing a source or
 * destination of data, while the {@code Disposable} interface is used for objects than can
 * be reused for different source or destination of data.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b> An {@link javax.imageio.ImageReader} can be instantiated once, then reused
 * for reading many images of the same format. An {@code ImageReader} implementation could
 * provide both the {@code close()} and {@code dispose()} methods:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@code close()} method for closing the stream of the current image being read,
 *       while keeping the {@code ImageReader} instance ready to accept new input streams for
 *       other images to read.</li>
 *   <li>The {@link javax.imageio.ImageReader#dispose() dispose()} method indicating that the
 *       {@code ImageReader} will not be used anymore and can release all internal resources.</li>
 * </ul>
