     * If the objects being compared are
     * {@link org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem} instances, then only the
     * properties relevant to the coordinate localization shall be compared. Metadata like the
     * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem#getIdentifiers() identifiers}
     * or the {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.crs.CoordinateReferenceSystem#getDomainOfValidity()
     * domain of validity}, which have no impact on the coordinates being calculated, shall be ignored.
     * <p>
     * If the objects being compared are {@link org.opengis.referencing.operation.MathTransform}
     * instances, then two transforms defined in a different way may be considered equivalent.
     * For example it is possible to define a
     * {@linkplain org.geotoolkit.referencing.operation.projection.Mercator Mercator} projection
     * in two different ways, as a {@code "Mercator (1SP)"} or a {@code "Mercator (2SP)"} projection,
     * each having their own set of parameters. The {@link #STRICT} or {@link #BY_CONTRACT} modes
     * shall consider two projections as equal only if their
     * {@linkplain org.geotoolkit.referencing.operation.transform.AbstractMathTransform#getParameterValues()
     * parameter values} are strictly identical, while the {@code IGNORE_METADATA} mode can consider
     * those objects as equivalent despite difference in the set of parameters, as long as coordinate
     * transformations still produce the same results.
     *
     * <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Example:</b> A {@code "Mercator (2SP)"} projection with a
     * {@linkplain org.geotoolkit.referencing.operation.projection.UnitaryProjection.Parameters#standardParallels
