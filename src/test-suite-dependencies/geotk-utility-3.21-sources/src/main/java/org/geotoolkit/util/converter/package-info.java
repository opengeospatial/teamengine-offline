/**
 * Performs conversions between instances of different classes. For example it is sometime
 * convenient to consider {@link java.util.Date} objects as if they were {@link java.lang.Long}
 * objects for computational purpose in generic algorithms. This particular conversion is
 * straightforward when the type are known at compile-time, but more tedious when they must
 * be determined dynamically at run-time. This package allow that in a two-steps process:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Get a converter from {@link org.geotoolkit.util.converter.ConverterRegistry} from
 *       a given <var>source</var> to a given <var>target</var> class.</li>
 *   <li>Use the obtained {@link org.geotoolkit.util.converter.ObjectConverter} instance
 *       for performing the conversions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A system-wide set of conversions is pre-defined and available by the
 * {@link org.geotoolkit.util.converter.ConverterRegistry#system()} method.
 *
 * {@section Example}
 * The following code convert instances in a collection from type {@code S} to type {@code T},
 * where the types are unknown at compile-time. Note that the converter is obtained only once
 * before to be applied to every elements in the loop.
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     Class<S> sourceType = ...
 *     Class<T> targetType = ...
 *     Collection<S> sources = ...;
 *     Collection<T> targets = ...;
 *     ObjectConverter<S,T> converter = ConverterRegistry.system().converter(sourceType, targetType);
 *     for (S source : sources) {
 *         targets.add(converter.convert(source));
 *     }
 * }
