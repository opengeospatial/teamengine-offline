/**
 * A task which can be given to many processes. The same {@code ShareableTask} instance
 * (or a copy of it through serialization-deserialization) can be given to an arbitrary
 * amount of processes, either on the local machine or on many remote machines. It is the
 * task responsibility to ensure that each process can pickup a unique portion of the task.
 * <p>
 * A convenient approach is to extract sub-portions of the task from a thread-safe, remotely
 * available object stream (typically backed by an iterator). The stream or iterator is given
 * to the constructor. In case of serialization, the object stream is exported as a remote
 * object for Remote Method Invocation (RMI).
 *
 * @param <Input>  The value given by the stream used as input to the task.
 * @param <Output> The return value of the task.
