/**
 * Throws when a null argument has been given to a method that doesn't accept them.

 * the error is an illegal argument rather than an unexpected usage of a null pointer
 * inside a method body.
 *
 * {@note We could argue that this exception should extend <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.
 *        However <code>NullPointerException</code> has become a more widely adopted practice and
 *        is now the recommended one in the <cite>Effective Java</cite> book.}
