/**
 * Thrown when {@link FactoryRegistry} is invoked recursively for the same category. This exception
 * is often the result of a programming error. It happen typically when an implementation of some
 * {@code FooFactory} interface queries in their constructor, directly or indirectly,
 * {@link FactoryRegistry#getServiceProvider getServiceProvider} for the same category (namely
 * {@code FooFactory.class}). Factories implemented as wrappers around other factories of the same
 * kind are the most likely to fall in this canvas. If this {@code RecursiveSearchException}
 * was not throw, the application would typically dies with a {@link StackOverflowError}.
 * <p>
 * A workaround for this exception is to invoke {@code getServiceProvider} outside the constuctor,
 * when a method first need it.
