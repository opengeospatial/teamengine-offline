/**
 * A coordinate reference system that is defined by its coordinate conversion from another
 * CRS but is not a projected CRS. This category includes coordinate reference systems derived
 * from a projected CRS, for example in order to use a {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.PolarCS}.
 *
 * {@section Note on the inclined case (two-dimensional)}
 * Some methods like {@link org.geotoolkit.referencing.CRS#isHorizontalCRS(CoordinateReferenceSystem)}
 * assume that the axes of the two-dimensional derived CRS are coplanar with the axes of the base CRS.
 * This is not always the case; for example it is possible to define a {@code DerivedCRS} on a plane
 * which is inclined relative to the base CRS. ISO 19111 does not specify how to handle such cases.
 * In Geotk we suggest a slight departure from the ISO standard: assign to the inclined {@code DerivedCRS}
 * a datum which is different than the base datum and which is not a
 * {@link org.opengis.referencing.datum.GeodeticDatum}.
 *
 * @todo Provides an API for specifying the datum at construction time which is different
 *       than the datum of the base CRS.
