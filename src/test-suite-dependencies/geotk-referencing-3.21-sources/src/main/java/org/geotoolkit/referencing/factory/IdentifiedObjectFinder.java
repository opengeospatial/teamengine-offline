/**
 * Lookups an object from an {@linkplain AuthorityFactory authority factory} which is
 * {@linkplain CRS#equalsIgnoreMetadata equal, ignoring metadata}, to the specified
 * object. The main purpose of this class is to get a fully {@linkplain IdentifiedObject
 * identified object} from an incomplete one, for example from an object without
 * {@linkplain IdentifiedObject#getIdentifiers identifiers} ("{@code AUTHORITY[...]}"
 * element in <cite>Well Known Text</cite> terminology).
 * <p>
 * The steps for using {@code IdentifiedObjectFinder} are:
 * <p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Get a new instance by calling
 *       {@link AbstractAuthorityFactory#getIdentifiedObjectFinder(Class)}.</li>
 *   <li>Optionally configure that instance by calling its setter methods.</li>
 *   <li>Perform a search by invoking the {@link #find(IdentifiedObject)} or
 *       {@link #findIdentifier(IdentifiedObject)} methods.</li>
 *   <li>Reuse the same {@code IdentifiedObjectFinder} instance for consecutive searches.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * {@section Thread safety}
 * {@code IdentifiedObjectFinder} are <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to be thread-safe
 * even if the underlying factory is thread-safe. If concurrent searches are desired,
 * then a new instance should be created for each thread.

     * {@code attempt} argument until this method returns {@code null}, which means that every
     * possible objects for the given code has been created. The purpose is to test various flavor
     * of the same object (for example with the axis order forced to "<cite>longitude first</cite>"
     * or not).
     * <p>
     * The default implementation delegates to the factory given at construction time only for
     * the first attempt {@code (attempt == 0)}, and returns {@code null} in all other cases.

     * This method is aimed to be overridden, but subclasses shall <strong>not</strong>
     * override it with caching service. For example do not delegate the creation to a
     * {@link CachingAuthorityFactory} instance.
     *
     * @param  code The authority code for which to create an object.
     * @param  attempt The number of previous attempt before this one.
     * @return The identified object for the given code, or {@code null} to stop attempts.
     * @throws FactoryException if an error occurred while creating the object.

     * conservatively contains the code for more objects if an exact search is too expensive.
     * <p>
     * This method is invoked by the default {@link #find find} method implementation. The caller
     * iterates through the returned codes, instantiate the objects and compare them with the

     * stops as soon as a match is found (in other words, if more than one object is equals to

     * @throws FactoryException if an error occurred while fetching the set of code candidates.
