 * Thrown when an assertion failed during a projection. Assertion failures are usually thrown
 * as {@link AssertionError}, but failures during projections are treated differently because
 * we can't be really sure that they will not happen (they are sensible to threshold values in
 * floating point comparisons). Declaring those assertion failures as a subclass of
 * {@link ProjectionException} allow applications - including our test suite - to handle those
 * exceptions in the way they usually do for normal projection exceptions.
