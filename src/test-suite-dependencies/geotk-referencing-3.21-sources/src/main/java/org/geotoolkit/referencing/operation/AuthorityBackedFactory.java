 * A {@linkplain CoordinateOperationFactory coordinate operation factory} extended with the extra
 * informations provided by an {@linkplain CoordinateOperationAuthorityFactory authority factory}.
 * Such authority factory may help to find transformation paths not available otherwise (often
 * determined from empirical parameters). Authority factories can also provide additional
 * informations like the
 * {@linkplain CoordinateOperation#getDomainOfValidity domain of validity},
 * {@linkplain CoordinateOperation#getScope scope} and
 * {@linkplain CoordinateOperation#getCoordinateOperationAccuracy accuracy}.
 * <p>
 * When <code>{@linkplain #createOperation createOperation}(sourceCRS, targetCRS)</code> is invoked,
 * {@code AuthorityBackedFactory} fetches the authority codes for source and target CRS and submits
 * them to the {@linkplain #getAuthorityFactory underlying authority factory} through a call to its
 * <code>{@linkplain CoordinateOperationAuthorityFactory#createFromCoordinateReferenceSystemCodes
 * createFromCoordinateReferenceSystemCodes}(sourceCode, targetCode)</code> method. If the
 * authority factory doesn't know about the specified CRS, then the default (standalone)
 * process from the super-class is used as a fallback.
