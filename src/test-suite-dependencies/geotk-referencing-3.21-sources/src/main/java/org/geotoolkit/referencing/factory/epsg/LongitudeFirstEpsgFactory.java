/**
 * An EPSG authority factory using (<var>longitude</var>, <var>latitude</var>) axis order.
 * This factory wraps a {@link ThreadedEpsgFactory} into an {@link OrderedAxisAuthorityFactory}
 * when first needed.
 * <p>
 * Users don't need to create explicitly an instance of this class. Instead, one can get
 * an instance using the following code:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     Hints hints = new Hints(Hints.FORCE_LONGITUDE_FIRST_AXIS_ORDER, Boolean.TRUE);
 *     CRSAuthorityFactory factory = AuthorityFactoryFinder.getCRSAuthorityFactory("EPSG", hints);
 * }
 *
 * {@section To be more specific...}
 * The name of this class contains "<cite>longitude first</cite>" for simplicity, because the axes
 * reordering apply mostly to geographic CRS (in contrast, most projected CRS already have
 * (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) axis order, in which case this class has no effect). However, what
 * this implementation actually does is to force a <cite>right-handed</cite> coordinate system.
 * This approach works for projected CRS as well as geographic CRS ("<cite>longitude first</cite>"
 * is an inappropriate expression for projected CRS). It even works in cases like stereographic
 * projections, where the axes names look like (<var>South along 180°</var>, <var>South along 90°E</var>).
 * In such cases, aiming for "<cite>longitude first</cite>" would not make sense.
 *
 * {@note This class implements also the <code>DatumAuthorityFactory</code> interface as a matter
 *        of principle, in order to have a single class implementing all factories. However this
 *        is in theory useless since "axis order" doesn't make any sense for datum.}
