/**
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.AuthorityFactory Authority factories} for the
 * <A HREF="http://www.epsg.org">EPSG</A> database. Every classes in this package except
 * {@link org.geotoolkit.referencing.factory.epsg.PropertyEpsgFactory} require a connection
 * to a database, which may be on Derby (a.k.a. JavaDB), HSQL, PostgreSQL or MS-Access.
 *
 *
 * {@section Installation}
 *
 * See <a href="doc-files/install.html">installation instructions</a>.
 *
 *
 * {@section Fetching a connection}
 *
 * By default, this package fetches a connection to a database in the {@code Geotoolkit.org/EPSG}
 * directory (relative to the user home directory). This database will be automatically created
 * if the {@code geotk-epsg} module is available on the classpath. The automatic installation and
 * usage will work only if one of the {@code derby.jar} or {@code hsql.jar} driver is available on
 * the classpath.
 * <p>
 * The connection to the database can also be specified explicitly in a simple properties file or
 * through JNDI. The steps used for fetching the connection parameters are described in the javadoc
 * of the {@link org.geotoolkit.referencing.factory.epsg.ThreadedEpsgFactory#getDataSource()} method.
 *
 *
 * {@section Getting a factory instance}
 *
 * An EPSG authority factory is created using the following code:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     CRSAuthorityFactory factory = AuthorityFactoryFinder.getCRSAuthorityFactory("EPSG", null);
 * }
 *
 *
 * {@section How CRS are identified}
 *
 * EPSG codes are numerical identifiers. For example "4326" is the EPSG identifier for the
 * "<cite>WGS 84</cite>" geographic CRS. However, the default implementation accepts names
 * as well as numeric identifiers. For example "<cite>NTF (Paris) / France I</cite>" and
 * {@code "27581"} both fetchs the same object. Note that names may be ambiguous since the
 * same name may be used for more than one object. This is the case of "<cite>WGS 84</cite>"
 * for example. If such an ambiguity is found, an exception will be thrown.
