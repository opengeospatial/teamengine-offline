/**
 * A caching authority factory which delegates to different instances of a backing store for
 * concurrency in multi-thread environment. This factory delays the {@linkplain #createBackingStore
 * creation of a backing store} until first needed, and {@linkplain AbstractAuthorityFactory#dispose
 * dispose} it after some timeout. This approach allows to establish a connection to a database (for

 * {@section Multi-threading}
 * If two or more threads are accessing this factory in same time, then two or more instances
 * of the backing store may be created. The maximal amount of instances to create is specified
 * at {@code ThreadedAuthorityFactory} construction time. If more backing store instances are
 * needed, some of the threads will block until an instance become available.
