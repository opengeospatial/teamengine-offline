/**
 * Helper framework for creating {@link org.geotoolkit.internal.sql.table.Entry} objects from
 * records in a {@link org.geotoolkit.internal.sql.table.Table}. Each table fetch the records
 * using a {@link org.geotoolkit.internal.sql.table.Query}.
 * <p>
 * This package is internal (not public) because the API is very specific to the needs of the
 * {@code geotk-coverage-sql} module, may change in any future version, and could be considered
 * as a duplicated (at least partially) of persistence frameworks like Hibernate. It was created
 * before Hibernate became in wide use, and is still used because it provides us maximal control
 * over the way we are querying the SQL database.
 * <p>
 * This package logically belong to the {@code geotk-coverage-sql} module.  But it is defined in
 * the {@code geotk-metadata-sql} module in order to allow other modules to use it. The metadata
 * SQL module does not use it itself right now, but it could use it in some future version.
