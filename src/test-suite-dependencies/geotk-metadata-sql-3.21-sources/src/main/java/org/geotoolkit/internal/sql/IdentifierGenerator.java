/**
 * Checks the existence of identifiers (usually primary keys) in a set of tables.
 * This class implements a very naive algorithm and is used only when some reasonably
 * meaningful ID are wanted. If "meaningful" ID is not a requirement, then it is much
 * more efficient to rely on the ID numbers generated automatically by the database.
 * <p>
 * This class checks if a given identifier exists in the database. If it exists, then
 * it searches for an unused {@code "proposal-n"} identifier, where {@code "proposal"}
 * is the given identifier and {@code "n"} is a number. The algorithm in this class
 * takes advantage of the fact that alphabetical order is not the same than numerical
 * order for scanning a slightly smaller amount of records (however the advantage is
 * significant only in some special cases - generally speaking this class is not for
 * table having thousands of identifier beginning with the given prefix). However the
 * selected numbers are not guaranteed to be in increasing order if there is "holes"
 * in the sequence of numbers (i.e. if some old records have been deleted). Generating
 * strictly increasing sequence is not a goal of this class, since it would be too costly.
 *
 * {@section Assumptions}
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code SELECT DISTINCT ID FROM "Table" WHERE ID LIKE 'proposal%' ORDER BY ID;} is
 *       assumed efficient. For example in the case of a PostgreSQL database, it requires
 *       PostgreSQL 8.0 or above with a {@code btree} index and C locale.</li>
 *   <li>The ordering of the {@code '-'} and {@code '0'} to {@code '9'} characters compared
 *       to other characters is the same than ASCII. This condition needs to hold only for
 *       those particular characters (the ordering between letters doesn't matter).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <K> The type of keys in the pool of prepared statements.
 * @param <V> The type of values in the pool of prepared statements.
