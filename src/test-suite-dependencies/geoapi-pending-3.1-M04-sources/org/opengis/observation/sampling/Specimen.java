/**
 * A located object on which measurements may be made.
 *
 * A basic material classification is provided using the "material" property.
 * Its value may be relatively generic (rock, pulp) or may reflect a detailed classification (calcrete, adamellite, biotite-schist).
 * In the latter case it is wise to use the codeSpace attribute to provide a link to the classification scheme/vocabulary used.
 *
 * Note that if this specimen is a "processed" version of another (e.g. by grinding, sieving, etc) then
 * the predecessor (if known) may be recorded as a relatedSamplingFeature.
