/**
 * A filter that passes only the Identifiers listed.
 * <p>
 * This application of this filter for Features is well established:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>FeatureId - used for GML2 Features</li>
 *   <li>GeometryId - used for GML3 Features and Geometry constructs</li>
 * </ul>
 * We also have the following identifiers:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>RecordId - from CSW-2</li>
 *   <li>ObjectId - from CSW-2</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * You can check what kind of Identifiers are supported using:<pre><code>
 * idCapabilities.hasFID() == true; // for FeatureId
 * idCapabilities.hasEID() == true; // no idea ...
 * </code></pre>
