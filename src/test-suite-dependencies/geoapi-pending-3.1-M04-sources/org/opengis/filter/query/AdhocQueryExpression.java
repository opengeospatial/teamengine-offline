 * A fundamental type of query expression is the ad hoc query expression. It is ad hoc in the sense that the
 * query is not known before the time it is being executed as, for example, a stored query would be.
 * <br/>
 * An ad hoc query expression is a query expression that contains the names of one or more resource types to
 * query, an optional projection clause enumerating the properties of the resource to present in the response, an
 * option selection clause that constraints the properties of those resources types in order to define a result set
 * and an optional sorting clause specifying the order in which the result set is presented.
