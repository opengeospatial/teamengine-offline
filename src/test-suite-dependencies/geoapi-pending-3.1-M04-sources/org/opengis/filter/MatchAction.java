/**
 * The matchAction attribute can be used to specify how the comparison predicate shall be evaluated for a
 * collection of values (e.g. in XML, properties having maxOccurs > 1) and not including some additional context
 * to identify a specific value from the collection to be tested. Possible values for the attribute are: All, Any or
 * One. A value of All means that all values in the collection shall satisfy the predicate. A value of Any means
 * that any of the value in the collection can satisfy the predicate. Finally, a value of One means that only one of
 * the values in the collection shall satisfy the predicate.
 * <br/>
 * Null value should be interpreted as ANY.
