/**
 * The OverlapBehavior element tells a system how to behave when multiple
 * raster images in a layer  overlap each other, for example with
 * satellite-image scenes. LATEST_ON_TOP and EARLIEST_ON_TOP refer to the
 * time the scene was captured.   AVERAGE means to average multiple scenes
 * together.   This can produce blurry results if the source images are
 * not perfectly aligned in their geo-referencing. RANDOM means to select
 * an image (or piece thereof) randomly and place it on top.  This can
 * produce crisper  results than AVERAGE potentially more efficiently than
 * LATEST_ON_TOP or EARLIEST_ON_TOP.   The default behaviour is
 * system-dependent.
 *
 * @return LATEST_ON_TOP, EARLIEST_ON_TOP, AVERAGE or RANDOM
