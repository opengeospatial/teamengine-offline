/**
 * The ContrastEnhancement element defines contrast enhancement for a channel of a
 * false-color image or for a color image.
 *
 * In the case of a color image, the relative grayscale brightness of a pixel color is used.
 * “Normalize” means to stretch the contrast so that the dimmest color is stretched to black
 * and the brightest color is stretched to white, with all colors in between stretched out
 * linearly. “Histogram” means to stretch the contrast based on a histogram of how many
 * colors are at each brightness level on input, with the goal of producing equal number of
 * pixels in the image at each brightness level on output. This has the effect of revealing
 * many subtle ground features.
