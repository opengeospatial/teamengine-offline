 * Abstract superclass of the symbolizers defined by the Symbology Encoding specification.

 * Please note you are not free to create your own subtype o Symbolizer - we are limited to LineSymbolizer, PointSymbolizer, PolygonSymbolizer, RasterSymbolizer and TextSymbolizer.
 * <p>
 * <b>using a static geometry<b/>
 * you can use static geometry if needed, see {@link #getGeometryAttribute}
 * </p>
 *
 * <b>Particular cases if the geometry is not the defined type of the symbolizer</b>
 * <p>
 * Geometry types other than inherently linear types can also be used. If a point geometry is
 * used, it should be interpreted as a line of "epsilon" (arbitrarily small) length with a
 * horizontal orientation centered on the point, and should be rendered with two end caps.
 * If a polygon is used (or other "area" type), then its closed outline is used as the line string
 * (with no end caps). If a raster geometry is used, its coverage-area outline is used for the
 * line, rendered with no end caps.
