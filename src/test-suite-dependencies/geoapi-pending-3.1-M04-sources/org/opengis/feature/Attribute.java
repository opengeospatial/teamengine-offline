/**
 * An extension of Property for an attribute, or data.
 * <p>
 * The notion of an "attribute" is similar to that of an attribute in UML.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is capable of modelling "primitive data", things like strings,
 * numerics, dates, etc... However for "complex data" (that is non-primitive
 * data types which are made up other primitive data types), a specific
 * sub-interface is used, see {@link ComplexAttribute}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An analogy for an attribute is a "field" in a java object. A field also
 * brings together a field name, value and type.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <h3>Identifiable</h3>
 *
 * When an attribute is identifiable the {@link #getID()} method returns a
 * unique identifier for the attribute. The type of the attribute is used to
 * determine identifiability.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Attribute attribute = ...;
 * if ( attribute.getType().isIdentified() ) {
 *   String id = attribute.getID();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <h3>Validation</h3>
 * 
 * An attribute may hold any value at runtime; checking that the value meets the constraints
 * supplied by the AttributeType is the work of the validate() method.
