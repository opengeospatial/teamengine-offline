/**
 * Extension of Property to represent an Association, or relationship, between two attributes.
 * <p>
 * The notion of an "association" is similar to that of an association in UML
 * and is used to model a relationship between entities.
 * </p>
 * Examples of such a relationship could be:
 * <ul>
 * <li>aggregation: An attribute may contain another attribute
 * <li>spatial: A feature is spatial related to another (touches, intersects, etc..)
 * <li>temporal: An is a previous version of another attribute in a versioning system
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * The value of an association is an {@link Attribute}. As an example consider
 * the following xml complex type definitions:
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;complexType name="fooType">
 *     ...
 *   &lt;/complexType>
 *   &lt;element name="foo" type="fooType"/>
 *
 *   &lt;complexType name="barType">
 *     &lt;sequence>
 *       &lt;element name="intAttribute" type="xs:int"/>
 *       &lt;element name="stringAttribute" type="xs:string"/>
 *       &lt;element name="fooAssociation" type="xlink:href"/>
 *     &lt;/sequence>
 *   &lt;/complexType>
 *   &lt;element name="bar" type="barType"/>
 * </pre>
 * In the above, "fooType" is an identifiable type. Now consider the following
 * section of an xml instance document:
 * <pre>
 *   &lt;foo id="someId">
 *     ...
 *   &lt;/foo>
 *   ...
 *   &lt;bar>
 *     &lt;intAttribute>1&lt;/intAttribute>
 *     &lt;stringAttribute>one&lt;/stringAttribute>
 *     &lt;fooAssociation>someId&lt;/fooAssociation>
 *   &lt;/bar>
 * </pre>
 * Realizing this as objects with attributes and associations we get:
 * <pre>
 *   ComplexAttribute bar = ...;
 *
 *   //intAttribute
 *   Attribute intAttribute = (Attribute) bar.getProperty( "intAttribute" );
 *   intAttribute.getValue() == 1
 *
 *   //stringAttribute
 *   Attribute stringAttribute = (Attribute) bar.getProperty( "stringAttribute" );
 *   stringAttribute.getValue() == "one"
 *
 *   //fooAssociation
 *   Association fooAssociation = (Association) bar.getProperty( "fooAssociation" );
 *   Attribute foo =  fooAssociation.getValue();
 * </pre>
 * </p>
