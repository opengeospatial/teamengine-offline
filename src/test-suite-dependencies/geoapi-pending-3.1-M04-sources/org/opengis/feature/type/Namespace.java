/**
 * A set of 0 or more names, with no duplicates.
 * <p>
 * A namespace contains {@link Name} objects. Each name usually corresponds to
 * the name of a type. The namespace uri of each name ({@link Namespace#getURI()}
 * is the same as the uri of the Namespace object containing it ({@link #getURI()}.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 *  //create namespace for gml
 *  Namespace namespace = new NamespaceImpl( "http://www.opengis.net/gml" );
 *
 *  //add some names
 *  namespace.add( new NameImpl( "http://www.opengis.net/gml", "PointType" ) );
 *  namespace.add( new NameImpl( "http://www.opengis.net/gml", "LineStringType" ) );

 * <h3>ISO 19103</h3>
 * The ISO 19103 specification asks that we have:
 * <ul>
 * <li>isGlobal()
 * <li>name() - inidicating the name of this namespace
 * <li>getNames() - set of names
 * </ul>
 * We have combined these concerns by making this a Set of Names,
 * and we remember the URI of this namespace.
 * <p>
 * One allowance ISO_19103 allows for is having a Namespace located inside another
 * namespace. You may certaintly do this by constructing a facility similar to Schema
 * in which namespaces may be looked up via a Name with the same URI as the one
 * used here.
 * <p>
 * We are simply not dictating the lookup mechanism, or a backpointer to
 * a containing namespace (note the two solutions are in conflict and we would like
 * to offer application the freedom to back this interface onto a facility such as
 * JNDI used in their own application).
