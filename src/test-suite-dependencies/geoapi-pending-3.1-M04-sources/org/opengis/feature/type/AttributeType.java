 * The type of an attribute.

 * of attributes.

 * An attribute may be "identifiable". When this is the case the attribute has a
 * unique identifier associated with it. See {@link Attribute#getID()}. The type
 * of the attribute specifies wether it is identifiable or not ({@link #isIdentified()}.
