/**
 * An interface for classes that want to perform operations on a SLD
 * hierarchy. It forms part of a GoF Visitor Pattern implementation.
 * <p>
 * A call to sld.accept(SLDVisitor) will result in a call to one of the
 * methods in this interface. The responsibility for traversing sub filters is
 * intended to lie with the visitor (this is unusual, but permitted under the
 * Visitor pattern).
 * <p>
 * A typical use would be to transcribe a sld into a specific format, e.g. XML or SQL.
 * Alternatively it may be to extract specific information from the SLD structure, for example a list of all fills.
 * Finally a a sld visitor is often used (in conjunction with a factory) in the production of a
 * copy; or slightly modified copy of the original sld.
 * <p>
 * It is common practice for a SLDVisitor to also implement a StyleVisitor and ExpressionVisitor in
 * order to traverse all data structures.
