/**
 * Evaluates a coverage at direct positions within a Thiessen polygon network constructed from a set
 * of discrete {@linkplain PointValuePair point-value pairs}. Evaluation is based on interpolation
 * between the centeres of the {@linkplain ThiessenValuePolygon Thiessen value polygons} surrounding
 * the input position.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Thiessen polygon networks</h3>
 * A finite collection of points on a plane determines a partition of the plane into a collection of
 * polygons equal in number to the collection of points. A Thiessen polygon is generated from one of
 * a defining set of points by forming the set of direct positions that are closer to that point than
 * to any other point in the defining set. The specific point is called the centre of the resulting
 * polygon. The boundaries between neighbouring polygons are the perpendicular bisectors of the lines
 * between their respective centres. Each polygon shares each of its edges with exactly one other
 * polygon. Each polygon contains exactly one point from the defining set. Thiessen polygons are
 * also known as Voronoi Diagrams or Proximal Sets.
 * <p>
 * A Thiessen polygon network is a tessellation of a 2D space using Thiessen polygons. A Thiessen
 * polygon network provides a structure that supports interpolation of feature attribute values from
 * the polygon centres to direct positions within the polygons.
