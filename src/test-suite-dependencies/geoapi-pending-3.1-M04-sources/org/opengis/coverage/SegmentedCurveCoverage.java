/**
 * Model phenomena that vary continuously or discontinuously along curves, which may be elements
 * of a network. The domain of a segmented curve coverage is described by a set of curves and
 * includes all the direct positions in all of the curves in the set.
 * <p>
 * Arc-length parameterization of a curve simplifies interpolation between direct positions on the
 * curve. Representation of phenomena that vary discontinuously along a curve requires segmentation
 * of the curve into regions of continuous variation. Such segmentation is also simplified by
 * arc-length parameterization. {@link Curve} supports arc-length parameterization. In particular,
 * the operation:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>{@link Curve#getParamForPoint}</blockquote>
 * <p>
 * returns the arc-length distance from the start point of the curve to the input direct position.
 * <p>
 * A segmented curve coverage operates on a domain composed of {@linkplain Curve curves}. It is
 * composed of a set of {@link ValueCurve}s, each of which maps feature attribute values to
 * position on a {@linkplain Curve curve}.
