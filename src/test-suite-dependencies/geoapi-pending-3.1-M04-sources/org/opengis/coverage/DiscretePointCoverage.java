/**
 * A discrete coverage characterized by a finite domain consisting of points. Generally, the domain
 * is a set of irregularly distributed points. However, the principal use of discrete point coverages
 * is to provide a basis for continuous coverage functions, where the evaluation of the continuous
 * coverage function is accomplished by interpolation between the points of the discrete point coverage.
 * Most interpolation algorithms depend upon a structured pattern of spatial relationships between the
 * points. This requires either that the points in the spatial domain of the discrete point coverage
 * be arranged in a regular way, or that the spatial domain of the continuous coverage be partitioned
 * in a regular way in relation to the points of the discrete point coverage. Grid coverages employ
 * the first method; Thiessen polygon coverages and TIN's employ the second.
 * <p>
 * <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> A set of hydrographic soundings is a discrete point coverage.
 * <p>
 * {@code DiscretePointCoverage} inherits the {@link #getElements elements} and the operations
 * {@link #locate locate}, {@link #find(DirectPosition,int) find}, and {@link #list list} from
 * {@link DiscreteCoverage}, with the restriction that the associated
 * {@linkplain GeometryValuePair geometry-value pairs} and those returned by the operations
 * shall be limited to {@linkplain PointValuePair point-value pairs}.
