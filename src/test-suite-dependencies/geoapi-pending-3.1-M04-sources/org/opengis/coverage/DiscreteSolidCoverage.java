/**
 * A coverage whose domain consists of a collection of {@linkplain Solid solids}. Solids or their
 * boundaries may be of any shape. Generally, the solids that constitute the domain of a coverage
 * are mutually exclusive and exhaustively partition the extent of the coverage, but this is not
 * required.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b> Buildings in an urban area could be represented as a set of unconnected
 *                 {@linkplain Solid solids} each with attributes such as building name,
 *                 address, floor space, and number of occupants.
 * <p>
 * As in the case of surfaces, the spatial domain of a discrete solid coverage may be a regular or
 * semiregular tessellation of the extent of the coverage. The tessellation can be defined in terms
 * of a 3 dimensional grid, where the set of grid cells is the spatial domain of the coverage.
