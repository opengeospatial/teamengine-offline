/**
 * Contains the geometric characteristics of a qualdrilateral grid. A grid is a network composed
 * of two or more sets of curves in which members of each set intersect the members of other sets
 * in a systematic way. The curves are called <cite>grid lines</cite>; the points at which they
 * intersect are <cite>grid points</cite>; the interstices between the grid lines are called
 * <cite>grid cells</cite>.
 * <p>
 * {@code Grid} has three subclasses, which lie in two partitions. The Positioning partition includes
 * {@link RectifiedGrid} and {@link ReferenceableGrid}, which contain information that relates the grid
 * coordinates to an external {@linkplain CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate reference system}. The
 * Valuation partition includes {@link GridValuesMatrix}, which contains information for assigning
 * values from the range to each of the grid points.
 * <p>
 * {@code Grid} is not an abstract class: an instance of {@code Grid} need not be an instance of any
 * of its subclasses. The partitions indicate that an instance of the subclass {@link GridValuesMatrix}
 * may be, at the same time, an instance of either the subclass {@link RectifiedGrid} or of the subclass
 * {@link ReferenceableGrid}.
