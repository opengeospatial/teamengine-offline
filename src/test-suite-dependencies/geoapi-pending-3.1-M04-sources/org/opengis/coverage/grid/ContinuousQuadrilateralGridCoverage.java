/**
 * A continuous coverage that operates on a {@linkplain GridValuesMatrix grid values matrix}.
 * The domain of a continuous quadrilateral grid coverage is the convex hull of the collection
 * of {@linkplain GridPoint grid points} defined by the grid values matrix. Evaluation of a
 * continuous quadrilateral grid coverage generates feature attribute values at direct positions
 * within the convex hull of the grid points provided by the grid values matrix. The general idea
 * is to extend the coverage to direct positions within the interior of each grid cell by
 * interpolation from the grid points at the corners of the cell.
