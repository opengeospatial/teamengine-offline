/**
 * Evaluates a coverage at direct positions within a network of hexagons centered on a set of grid
 * points. Evaluation is based on interpolation between the centres of the {@link ValueHexagon}s
 * surrounding the input position.
 * <p>
 * Coverages are sometimes based on tessellations composed of regular hexagons. Such tessellations
 * are usually called hexagonal grids. In fact, the centers of a set of regular hexagons that form
 * such a tessellation correspond to the grid points of a quadrilateral grid. That grid can be
 * described as a rectified grid in which the two offset vectors are of equal length but differ in
 * direction by 60&deg;. The length of a side of the hexagon is <var>L</var> = <var>S</var>&times;tan&nbsp;30&deg;,
 * where <var>S</var> is the length of the offset vector. This means that the values in the coverage
 * range can be stored as a grid values matrix and accessed through a sequence rule. The hexagons
 * are the Thiessen polygons that are generated around the grid points.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> A set of Thiessen polygons generated from the grid points of any 2-dimensional
 * rectified grid described by two offset vectors that are equal in length but not orthogonal
 * will be a set of congruent hexagons. The hexagons will be irregular unless the offset vectors
 * differ in direction by exactly 60&deg;.
