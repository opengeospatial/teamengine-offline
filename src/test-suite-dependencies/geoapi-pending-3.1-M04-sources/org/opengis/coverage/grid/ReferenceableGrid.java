 *       i.e. exactly fitting on all GridPoints.<br>
 *       Martin: a possible approach is to import the "gridToCRS" attribute from the legacy OGC
 *       specification, exactly as proposed for {@link RectifiedGrid}. Two ReferenceableGrids with
 *       the same grid geometry and the same "gridToCRS" math transform are exactly fitting on all
