/**
 * Provides operations for different ways of accessing the grid coverage values as well as
 * image processing functionality. The list of available processing operations is implementation
 * dependent. The interface has a discovery mechanism to determine the available processing
 * operations.
 * <p>
 * These processing operations will transform values within a single sample dimension, and
 * leave the values in other sample dimensions unaffected. The modified sample dimension may
 * also change its type (e.g. from {@link SampleDimensionType#UNSIGNED_4BITS UNSIGNED_4BITS} to
 * {@link SampleDimensionType#UNSIGNED_1BIT UNSIGNED_1BIT}). The actual underlying grid data
 * remains unchanged.
 * <p>
 * The interface has been designed to allow the adaptations to be done in a "pipe-lined" manner.
 * The interface operates on {@link GridCoverage} to create new a {@link GridCoverage}. The
 * interface does not need to make a copy of the source grid data. Instead, it can return a
 * grid coverage object which applies the adaptations on the original grid coverage whenever
 * a block of data is requested. In this way, a pipeline of several grid coverages can be
 * constructed cheaply.
 * <p>
 * This interface can perform any of the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Change the number of bands being accessed.</li>
 *   <li>Change the value sequencing in which the grid values are retrieved.</li>
 *   <li>Allow re-sampling of the grid coverage for a different geometry.
 *       Creating a new {@link GridCoverage} with different grid geometry allows for reprojecting
 *       the grid coverage to another projection and another georeferencing type, resampling to
 *       another cell resolution and subsetting the grid coverage.</li>
 *   <li>Modify the way the grid values are accessed (filtered, classified...).</li>
 *   <li>Change the interpolation method used when evaluating points which fall between grid cells.</li>
 *   <li>Filtering.</li>
 *   <li>Image enhancements.</li>
 *   <li><i>etc.</i></li>
 * </ul>
