/**
 * A {@linkplain ContinuousCoverage continuous coverage} characterized by a {@linkplain Tin TIN}.
 * The feature attribute values are computed by interpolation within each triangle in the
 * tessellation using the record of feature attribute values provided at each corner; that
 * is, the feature attribute values are produced by an operation on {@link ValueTriangle}s.
 * <p>
 * The basic idea of a TIN is to partition the convex hull of the points in the domain of a
 * discrete point coverage into a computationally unique set of non-overlapping triangles.
 * Each triangle is formed by three of the points in the domain of the discrete point coverage.
 * The Delaunay triangulation method is commonly used to produce TIN tessellations with triangles
 * that are optimally equiangular in shape, and are generated in such a manner that the
 * circumscribing circle containing each triangle contains no point of the discrete point
 * coverage other than those at the vertices of the triangle. {@link Tin} describes a Delaunay
 * triangulation.
