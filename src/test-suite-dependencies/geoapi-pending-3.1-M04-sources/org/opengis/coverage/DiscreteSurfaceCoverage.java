/**
 * A coverage whose domain consists of a collection of {@linkplain Surface surfaces}. In most cases,
 * the surfaces that constitute the domain of a coverage are mutually exclusive and exhaustively
 * partition the extent of the coverage. Surfaces or their boundaries may be of any shape. The
 * boundaries of component surfaces often correspond to natural phenomena and are highly irregular.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b> A coverage that represents soil types typically has a spatial domain
 *                 composed of surfaces with irregular boundaries.
 * <p>
 * Any set of polygons can be used as a spatial domain for a discrete surface coverage. Spatial
 * domains composed of congruent polygons are very common. Very often, these domains are composed
 * of congruent rectangles or regular hexagons. The geometry of such a tessellation may be
 * described in terms of a quadrilateral grid or a hexagonal grid. The spatial domain of a
 * discrete surface coverage may also consist of the triangles that compose a TIN, or the
 * polygons of a Thiessen polygon network.
