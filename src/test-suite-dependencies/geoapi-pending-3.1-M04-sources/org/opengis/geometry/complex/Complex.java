/**
 * A collection of geometrically disjoint, simple {@linkplain Primitive primitives}. If a
 * {@linkplain Primitive primitive} (other than a {@linkplain Point point} is in a particular
 * {@code Complex}, then there exists a set of primitives of lower dimension in the same complex
 * that form the boundary of this primitive.
 * <p>
 * A geometric complex can be thought of as a set in two distinct ways. First, it is a finite set
 * of objects (via delegation to its elements member) and, second, it is an infinite set of point
 * values as a subtype of geometric object. The dual use of delegation and subtyping is to
 * disambiguate the two types of set interface. To determine if a {@linkplain Primitive primitive}
 * <var>P</var> is an element of a {@code Complex} <var>C</var>,
 * call: {@code C.element().contains(P)}.
 * <p>
 * The "{@linkplain #getElements elements}" attribute allows {@code Complex} to inherit the
 * behavior of {@link Set Set&lt;Primitive&gt;} without confusing the same sort of behavior
 * inherited from {@link org.opengis.geometry.TransfiniteSet TransfiniteSet&lt;DirectPosition&gt;}
 * inherited through {@link Geometry}. Complexes shall be used in application schemas where
 * the sharing of geometry is important, such as in the use of computational topology. In a
 * complex, primitives may be aggregated many-to-many into composites for use as attributes
 * of features.
