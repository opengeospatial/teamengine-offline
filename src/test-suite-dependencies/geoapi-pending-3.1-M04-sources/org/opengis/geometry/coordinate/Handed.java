/**
 * Labels coordinate systems as being right or left handed as commonly defined in Mathematics.
 * This really only has meaning if the coordinate system is spatial. This is needed since most
 * mathematical algorithms need to know or potentially modify the handedness of a coordinate
 * system to maintain the proper representation of space.
 *
 * <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Note:</b>
 * The default for mathematics is right-handed systems (classic <var>x</var>-<var>y</var>, or
 * <var>x</var>-<var>y</var>-<var>z</var> order in Cartesian coordinates), while many geographic
 * coordinate reference systems are left-handed. This mathematical choice is seen in several
 * decisions; such as the inside of a surface is to the left of its boundary, the inside of a
 * solid is below its boundary, and the very concepts of oriented primitives and algebraic topology.
 * This bias toward right-handed systems is also seen in computer graphics and in engineering.
