/**
 * A polynimal spline.
 * An "<var>n</var><sup>th</sup> degree" polynomial spline shall be defined piecewise as an
 * <var>n</var>-degree polynomial, with up to C<sup><var>n</var>-1</sup> continuity
 * at the control points where the defining polynomial changes. This level of continuity is
 * controlled by the attribute {@link #getNumDerivativesInterior numDerivativesInterior}.
 * Parameters shall include directions for as many as degree - 2 derivatives of the polynomial
 * at the start and end point of the segment. {@link LineString} is equivalent to a
 * 1<sup>st</sup> degree polynomial spline. It has simple continuity at the
 * {@linkplain #getControlPoints control points} (C</sup>0</sup>), but does
 * not require derivative information (degree - 2 = -1).
 * <p>
 * NOTE: The major difference between the polynomial splines and the b-splines (basis splines)
 * is that polynomial splines pass through their control points, making the control point and
 * sample point array identical.
