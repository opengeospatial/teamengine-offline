 * Represents the rearrangement of a list, or a projection. The main usage of this interface is
 * to determine the differences in the order in which a {@link CoordinateSystem} axes are defined
 * and the order in which they are used in a {@link DirectPosition}.
 *
 * <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Note:</b>
 * This is helpful, because forcing the {@linkplain CoordinateReferenceSystem coordinate reference system}
 * to be in the {@link CoordinateSystem} as the first coordinate offsets will often force the system
 * to be left handed. Using a odd-permutation on the spatial offsets will flip this to a right handed
 * system, and allow graphics-based or engineering-based software to deal with coordinate as stored
 * in the {@link DirectPosition} without the worry of mirror images, which is the result of getting
 * the handedness of a coordinate system wrong. The usual permutation with simply flip the first and
 * second offset.</font></blockquote>
