/**
 * A planar polygon defined by 3 corners. That is, a triangle would be the result of a constructor
 * of the form: {@code Polygon(LineString({P1, P2, P3, P1}))} where <var>P</var><sub>1</sub>,
 * <var>P</var><sub>2</sub>, and <var>P</var><sub>3</sub> are three {@linkplain Position positions}.
 * Triangles have no holes. Triangle shall be used to construct
 * {@linkplain TriangulatedSurface triangulated surfaces}.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> The points in a triangle can be located in terms of their corner points
 * by defining a set of barycentric coordinates, three nonnegative numbers <var>c</var><sub>1</sub>,
 * <var>c</var><sub>2</sub>, and <var>c</var><sub>3</sub> such that
 *
 * <var>c</var><sub>1</sub> + <var>c</var><sub>2</sub> + <var>c</var><sub>3</sub> = 1.0.
 *
 * Then, each point <var>P</var> in the triangle can be expressed for some set of barycentric coordinates as:
 * <p>
 * <blockquote>
 * P = <var>c</var><sub>1</sub><var>P</var><sub>1</sub> +
 *     <var>c</var><sub>2</sub><var>P</var><sub>2</sub> +
 *     <var>c</var><sub>3</sub><var>P</var><sub>3</sub>
