     * upNormal (for sake of mathematical consistency) points into the center of the voided region,

     * is that the basic linguistic metaphors used in most languages for "interior of solid" and
     * for "interior of container" use "inward" in inconsistent manners from a topological point
     * of view. The void "in" rock is not inside the rock in the same manner as the solid material
     * that makes up the substance of the rock. Nor is the coffee "in" the cup the same "in" as
     * the ceramic glass "in" the cup. The use of these culturally derived metaphors may not be
     * consistent across all languages, some of which may use different prepositions for these two
     * different concepts. This specification uses the linguistically neutral concept of "interior"
     * derived from mathematics (topology).
