/**
 * The clothoid (or Cornu's spiral), a plane curve whose curvature is a fixed function of

 * <P><center>(TODO: paste the equation here)</center></P>
 *
 * This geometry is mainly used as a transition curve between curves of type straight
 * line/circular arc or circular arc/circular arc. With this curve type it is possible
 * to achieve a C2-continous transition between the above mentioned curve types. One
 * formula for the clothoid is <var>A</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>R</var>&times;<var>t</var>
 * where <var>A</var> is a constant, <var>R</var> is the varying radius of curvature along
 * the curve and <var>t</var> is the length along the curve and given in the Fresnel integrals.
