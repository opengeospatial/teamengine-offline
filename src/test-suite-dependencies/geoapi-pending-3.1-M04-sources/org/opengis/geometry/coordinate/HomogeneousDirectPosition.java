/**
 * A direct position adding another element to the coordinate array which carries a non-zero
 * “weight”, and multiplies all other columns in the coordinate array by that weight.
 * “Homogeneous coordinates” equates, for every <var>w</var>&ne;0, the coordinate (<var>wx</var>,
 * <var>wy</var>, <var>wz</var>, <var>w</var>) in four-dimensional Euclidean space with the point
 * (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>z</var>) in three-dimensional Euclidean space. This mapping
 * is used heavily in projective geometry which aids implementers in creating realistic perspective
 * views of higher dimensional geometry, and will also be used here in the definition of rational
 * splines.
 *
 * @departure historic
 *   The ISO 19107 draft document defines a single interface, <code>DirectPosition</code>, with
 *   a <code>isHomgeneous</code> attribute. In GeoAPI, we keep the historical direct position
 *   interface mostly unchanged, defines the new properties in a separated type, and replace
 *   the <code>isHomgeneous</code> attribute by a <code>instanceof</code> check.
