/**
 * Two distinct {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.DirectPosition direct positions}
 * (the {@linkplain #getStartPoint start point} and {@linkplain #getEndPoint end point}) joined
 * by a straight line. Thus its interpolation attribute shall be
 * {@link org.opengis.geometry.primitive.CurveInterpolation#LINEAR LINEAR}.
 * The default parameterization is:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * L = {@linkplain #getEndParam endParam} - {@linkplain #getStartParam startParam}
 * c(s) = ControlPoint[1]+((s-{@linkplain #getStartParam startParam})/L)*(ControlPoint[2]-ControlPoint[1])
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * Any other point in the control point array must fall on this line. The control points of a
 * {@code LineSegment} shall all lie on the straight line between its start point and end
 * point. Between these two points, other positions may be interpolated linearly. The linear
 * interpolation, given using a constructive parameter <var>t</var>, 0 ? <var>t</var> ? 1.0,
 * where c(o) = c.{@linkplain #getStartPoint startPoint} and c(1)=c.{@link #getEndPoint endPoint},
 * is:
 *
 * <blockquote>
 * <var>c</var>(<var>t</var>) = <var>c</var>(0)(1-<var>t</var>) + <var>c</var>(1)<var>t</var>
