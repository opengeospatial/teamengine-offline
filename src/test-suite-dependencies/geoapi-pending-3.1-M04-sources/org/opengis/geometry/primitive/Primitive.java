/**
 * Abstract root class of the geometric primitives. Its main purpose is to define the basic
 * "boundary" operation that ties the primitives in each dimension together. A geometric primitive
 * is a geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. This
 * includes curves and surfaces, even though they are composed of curve segments and surface patches,
 * respectively. Those curve segments and surface patches cannot exist outside the context of a
 * primitive.
 * <p>
 * Any geometric object that is used to describe a feature is a collection of geometric primitives.
 * A collection of geometric primitives may or may not be a geometric complex. Geometric complexes
 * have additional properties such as closure by boundary operations and mutually exclusive component
 * parts. {@code Primitive} and {@link Complex} share most semantics, in the meaning of operations
 * and attributes. There is an exception in that a {@code Primitive} shall not contain its boundary
 * (except in the trivial case of {@linkplain Point point} where the boundary is empty), while a
 * {@linkplain Complex complex} shall contain its boundary in all cases.
