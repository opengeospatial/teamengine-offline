/**
 * Primitives that can be mirrored into new geometric objects in terms of their internal local
 * coordinate systems (manifold charts). For curves, the orientation reflects the direction in
 * which the curve is traversed, that is, the sense of its parameterization. When used as boundary
 * curves, the surface being bounded is to the "left" of the oriented curve. For surfaces, the
 * orientation reflects from which direction the local coordinate system can be viewed as right
 * handed, the "top" or the surface being the direction of a completing <var>z</var>-axis that
 * would form a right-handed system. When used as a boundary surface, the bounded solid is "below"
 * the surface. The orientation of points and solids has no immediate geometric interpretation in
 * 3-dimensional space.
 * <p>
 * {@code OrientablePrimitive} objects are essentially references to geometric primitives
 * that carry an "orientation" reversal flag (either "+" or "-") that determines whether this
 * primitive agrees or disagrees with the orientation of the referenced object.
 *
 * <blockquote><font size=2>
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> There are several reasons for subclassing the "positive" primitives
 * under the orientable primitives. First is a matter of the semantics of subclassing. Subclassing
 * is assumed to be a "is type of" hierarchy. In the view used, the "positive" primitive is simply
 * the orientable one with the positive orientation. If the opposite view were taken, and orientable
 * primitives were subclassed under the "positive" primitive, then by subclassing logic, the
 * "negative" primitive would have to hold the same sort of geometric description that the
 * "positive" primitive does. The only viable solution would be to separate "negative" primitives
 * under the geometric root as being some sort of reference to their opposite. This adds a great
 * deal of complexity to the subclassing tree. To minimize the number of objects and to bypass this
 * logical complexity, positively oriented primitives are self-referential (are instances of the
 * corresponding primitive subtype) while negatively oriented primitives are not.
