/**
 * Curve with a positive orientation. {@code Curve} is
 * a descendent subtype of {@link Primitive} through {@link OrientablePrimitive}. It is the basis
 * for 1-dimensional geometry. A curve is a continuous image of an open interval and so could be
 * written as a parameterized function such as
 *
 * <code>c(t):(a,&nbsp;b) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code>
 *
 * where "t" is a real parameter and E<sup>n</sup> is Euclidean space of dimension <var>n</var>
 * (usually 2 or 3, as determined by the coordinate reference system). Any other parameterization
 * that results in the same image curve, traced in the same direction, such as any linear shifts
 * and positive scales such as
 *
 * <code>e(t) = c(a&nbsp;+&nbsp;t(b-a)):(0,1) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code>,
 *
 * is an equivalent representation of the same curve. For the sake of simplicity, {@code Curve}s
 * should be parameterized by arc length, so that the parameterization operation inherited from
 * {@link GenericCurve} will be valid for parameters between 0 and the length of the curve.
 * <p>
 * Curves are continuous, connected, and have a measurable length in terms of the coordinate system.
 * The orientation of the curve is determined by this parameterization, and is consistent with the
 * tangent function, which approximates the derivative function of the parameterization and shall
 * always point in the "forward" direction. The parameterization of the reversal of the curve defined
 * by
 *
 * <code>c(t):(a,&nbsp;b) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code>
 *
 * would be defined by a function of the form
 *
 * <code>s(t) = c(a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b&nbsp;-&nbsp;t):(a,&nbsp;b) &rarr; E<sup>n</sup></code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * A curve is composed of one or more curve segments. Each curve segment within a curve may be
 * defined using a different interpolation method. The curve segments are connected to one another,
 * with the end point of each segment except the last being the start point of the next segment in
 * the segment list.
