/**
 * A factory for managing {@linkplain Precision direct position} creation. A
 * Precision is used to describe the accuracy at which you would like your
 * geometry maintained during operations and transformations.
 * <p>
 * Here are a couple of examples of creating a Precision using a
 * PrecisionFactory:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * factory.createPrecision(PrecisionType.FIXED, 1000); // three significant digits
 * factory.createPrecision(PrecisionType.FLOAT, 0); // float precision - 6 digits
 * factory.createPrecision(PrecisionType.DOUBLE, 0); // double precision - 16 digits
 * <code></pre>
 * Although the
 * DirectPosition makes use of double when representing ordinates some
 * implementations, transfer mechanisms or storage facilities will not be able
 * to maintain this accuracy. In order to maintain a valid geometry representation
 * in these situations you will need to provide a {@link Percision} as a stratagy
 * object used to round coordinates during creation and transformation. We cannot
 * allow you to round to the correct precision afterwards as the result may be an
 * invalid geometry.
 * <p>
 * The easiest example is the construction of a very small
 * poloygon for a WFS configured to use 2 significant digits when generating
 * GML. When generating a polgon in meters of less than 1 cm in size the
 * rounding policy would "collapse" all the points of the outer ring into the
 * same location - a WFS faced with this situtation may choose to skip the polygon
 * or represent it as a Point.
