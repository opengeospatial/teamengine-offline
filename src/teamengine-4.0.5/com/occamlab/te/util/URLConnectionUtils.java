     * Get an input stream from a URL connection. In case of an IOException, get
     * the ErrorStream instead, if it is available. This makes it possible to
     * obtain an ows:ExceptionReport when the server returns HTTP code 400 Bad
     * Request.
     * 
     * This method depends upon features of class
     * sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection introduced in Java version 7
     * (JDK 1.7.0). From its Javadoc:
     * 
     * System properties related to error stream handling:
     * 
     * sun.net.http.errorstream.enableBuffering = <boolean>
     * 
     * With the above system property set to true (default is false), when the
     * response code is >=400, the HTTP handler will try to buffer the response
     * body (up to a certain amount and within a time limit). Thus freeing up
     * the underlying socket connection for reuse. The rationale behind this is
     * that usually when the server responds with a >=400 error (client error or
     * server error, such as 404 file not found), the server will send a small
     * response body to explain who to contact and what to do to recover. With
     * this property set to true, even if the application doesn't call
     * getErrorStream(), read the response body, and then call close(), the
     * underlying socket connection can still be kept-alive and reused. The
     * following two system properties provide further control to the error
     * stream buffering behaviour.
     * 
     * sun.net.http.errorstream.timeout = <int> the timeout (in millisec)
     * waiting the error stream to be buffered; default is 300 ms
     * 
     * sun.net.http.errorstream.bufferSize = <int> the size (in bytes) to use
     * for the buffering the error stream; default is 4k
     * 
     * @return InputStream from URLConnection if available, or the error stream
     *         if the connection failed but the server sent useful data, or
     *         null.
